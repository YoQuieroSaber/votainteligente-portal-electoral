- [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
- [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

## Theming

### Previously created themes

* [votainteligente-venezuela-theme](https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/votainteligente-venezuela-theme) is the theme for [eligetucandidato.org](http://eligetucandidato.org/)
* [votai-theme](https://github.com/YoQuieroSaber/votai-theme) is the theme for the YoQuieroSaber.org Argentinian gamified instance.


### Creating your own custom theme

If you want to create a new theme you have to create a directory containing two different subdirectories templates and static, and copy the templates that you want to replace.

And in your project in your local_settings.py file you have to add the following

```
 STATICFILES_DIRS = (
     '/full/path/to/your/theme/static/',
 )
 TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
     '/full/path/to/your/theme/templates/',
 )
```
